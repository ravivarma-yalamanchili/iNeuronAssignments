## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
	Python is a high-level programming language as it is easily understandable by us and very similar to English.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
	Because in python we don't need to mention the type of the variable, it will automatically assign the data-type 

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
	Pros:	1) It's very easy to learn
			2) we can use python in multiple fields like web development, APP dev, Gaming, Bigdata, AI/ML
			3) Open Source and large number of libraries available
	
	Cons:	1) Slow when compared to Java or other complied languages
			2) Memory consumption is also high 
			3) Less secure as it is open source

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
	We can use it multiple fields like web development, APP dev, Gaming, Bigdata, AI/ML, Data Science

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
		Variable is a name given to the value and we can use it in program as a reference to that value
		a = 10 # Here a is a variable

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
		using the input function
		a = input("Enter the value")

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
		String

Q8. What is type casting?
		We can covert the type of the value into another type
		for example the value coming from input is str and if we want to can convert that into int/float/date etc
		a = int(input("Enter the value"))

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
	Yes, We can do it by using split function
		lst = input("Enter the value").split(' ') # The input will be taken as a list and after every space it will be considered as new value

Q10. What are keywords?
		Keywords are reserved words in python and they has specific functionality.
		we can't use them as a variables in program
		like str,int,pass,break, def

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
		We can't use them as a variables in program because it has specific functionality
		If we use them as variables python interpreter will not able to treat them as variables and will throw an error
		
Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentation in Python?
		Indentation is to give proper spacing between different parts of the code.
		In python, it is mandatory to follow the indentation, then only interpreter can identify the differences in the code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
		We can use print function for that
		print("Hey I'm currently working on my assignment)

Q14. What are operators in Python?
		We have different type of Operators in any language.
			Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, //, %
			Logical operators : and, or, not
			Relational operators: >, >=, <, <=, ==, 
			
Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
		/ --> will do the normal division and gives the output in floating point numbers if the division results floating number
		// --> It is an integer division, which results only the integer part of the divisor
		
Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
		print("iNeuron" *4)

		for i in range(4):
			print("iNeuron", end = '')
	
	
Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

	n = int(input("Enter the number to check weather it is even or odd))
	
	if n%2 == 0:
		print(n " is a even number")
	
	else:
		print(n " is a odd number")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
		True and false 

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 --> 1

0 and 0 --> 0

True and False and True --> False

1 or 0 or 0 --> 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
		These can be evaluted to either True or False based on the conditions
		

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
		These can be used to check the conditions and can be used to change the flow of control

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
		age = int(input("Enter the age of the person: "))
	
		if age >= 18:
			print("I can vote")
		
		else:
			print("I can't vote")
		

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
		even = [x for x in numbers if x%2 ==0]
		print(sum(even))


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

		# print(max(a,b,c))

		if (a >= b) and (a >= c):
				largest = a
		  
		elif (b >= a) and (b >= c):
			largest = b
		else:
			largest = c
				
		print(largest)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

		res =[]

		for i in numbers:
			if i > 500:
				break
			elif i > 150:
				pass
			elif i%5 == 0:
				res.append(i)

		print(res)
